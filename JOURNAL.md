# June 24th: I spend some time thinking about the design and decided on making a 1lb plasic antweight combat robot.

 this robot will be a 4wd vertical spinner but not the normal ways of tangent and belts it going to be an all geared drive with a total reduction ratio of 5.33:1 which means the wheels I have will be spinning around 11.48 mph at top speed.

#June 24th: I started designing the body and weapon.

 when i make things there usually to big but this time im trying to make it as tight as possible so far the body is only 100mm wide which is pretty small considering my other robot is 228mm wide, I started with putting the drive pods i created yesterday into the cad and alligning them to the distance i needed, then i imported and created the rest of the parts like the battery, reciever, and esc's. Then I started designing the frame, uprights, and front wedge, i chose 6mm thick for the upright and most parts of the body 3mm thick. the gear boxes might be a little tall so i may need to create a form of armor just for those to protect from horizontals.

#June 25th: I finished the design.. for now and madde some final touches

Today i continued cadding the robot and when i starting thinking it was done i relized it had more then a few flaws, like it not being able to drive upside down and the uprights just being abled to get ripped out like its nothing, to counteract the no driving upside down issue i made something a little wonky, i made the bot 6wd which caused its own fair share of issues, in the future after testing i may remove the third wheel to make it normal 4wd. i also added supports under the uprights so the screws couldent just rip out of the robot. i also ended up creating the wheel armor i was talking about before. i also made the forks for ground game.
