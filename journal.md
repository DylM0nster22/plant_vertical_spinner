# Total Time Spent 

# June 24th: I spend some time thinking about the design and decided on making a 1lb plasic antweight combat robot, this will be a 4wd vertical spinner but not the normal ways of tangent and belts it going to be an all geared drive with a total reduction ratio of 5.33:1 which means the wheels I have will be spinning around 11.48 mph at top speed.
