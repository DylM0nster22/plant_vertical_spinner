# Total Time Spent: 9hr

# June 24th: I spend some time thinking about the design and decided on making a 1lb plasic antweight combat robot.

 this robot will be a 4wd vertical spinner but not the normal ways of tangent and belts it going to be an all geared drive with a total reduction ratio of 5.33:1 which means the wheels I have will be spinning around 11.48 mph at top speed.

**Total Time Spent: 2hr**

#June 24th: I started designing the body and weapon.

 when i make things there usually to big but this time im trying to make it as tight as possible so far the body is only 100mm wide which is pretty small considering my other robot is 228mm wide, I started with putting the drive pods i created yesterday into the cad and alligning them to the distance i needed, then i imported and created the rest of the parts like the battery, reciever, and esc's. Then I started designing the frame, uprights, and front wedge, i chose 6mm thick for the upright and most parts of the body 3mm thick. the gear boxes might be a little tall so i may need to create a form of armor just for those to protect from horizontals.
