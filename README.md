This is a plastic antweight vertical spinner that is going to be called edgehog, its going to be made out of overture superpla+, the weapon weights about 100g which is quarter of the weight with the body only weighs half of that, so thats fun. 

I made the combat robot because while i have made plastic antweight robots before most used the same boring drive as everyone else, like direct drive, tangent drive, or belted drive, this bot uses gears to connected and get gear down ratios to be a 5.33:1 gear ratio which means the 1550kv motor spinning at 18600 rpm will only amount to 3489.681051 rpm, which means the bot will move at about 11.1 mph. with the gears i still didnt feel like it was unique enough so i did something goofy i made it 6wd which also helps it drive upside down.

Here is a picture of the 6wd
